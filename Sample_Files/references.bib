@article{Stern,
title = {Soviet natural gas development to 1990: the implications for the {CMEA} and the West},
author = {Stern, J.P.},
abstractNote = {Since 1973, one of the major problems for an energy-deficient Western world has been the search for alternative sources of fuels in order to reduce dependence on Middle East energy supplies. This search has taken two paths: (1) a greater stress on domestic capabilities with respect to developing indigenous fossil-fuel resources, coupled with increasing research into alternative-energy technologies; and (2) an attempt to diversify the sources of fuel imports in order to reduce dependence on a single country or group of countries. In connection with the latter alternative, much attention has come to focus on the Soviet Union, with its enormous resource base, as a possible source of energy supplies. Although Western literature on Soviet energy has concentrated primarily on oil production and export potential. An estimated one-third of the world's natural gas reserves are located in Soviet territory. The country has, in a relatively short time, become a major gas producer and exporter and there is every reason to expect a significant expansion of both these functions in the future. This study considers the contribution that Soviet natural gas will make in the 1980s to the overall energy situation in the U.S.S.R. and in other member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA): Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and Romania. The role of natural gas is analyzed first in terms of domestic production and utilization and then in terms of the potential for exports to both Eastern Europe and the West. special attention is devoted to the development of Soviet natural gas exports to the West and the strategic implications of this trade. 78 references, 31 figures, 2 tables.},
