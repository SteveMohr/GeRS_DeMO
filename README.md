# GeRS-DeMo

## To use the GeRS-DeMo model, 
Download `dist.zip` and unzip, and store it somewhere on the computer (windows machines only)
Then double click on the `Resource_Model.exe` file. 
With a bit of luck the model will start, if it doesn't please run it in command line
and let me know what the error message is - fingers crossed it will be a simple fix. 
The folde Samples_Files contain some files to play with the program. (i.e. sample production, URR tables etc.)

For more info on the model please see:
